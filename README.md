## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Tool/Framework | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **HTML5**      | Structure of the page |
| **CSS3**       | Custom styles for the hero section and animations |
| **Tailwind CSS** (v2.2.19 via CDN) | Utility-first CSS for layout, responsiveness, and styling |

Tailwind was used for its responsive utility classes, fast prototyping, and clean integration with HTML for building modern layouts quickly.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive across:

- Mobile devices
- Tablets
- Desktops

Tailwind CSS breakpoints were used to ensure layout adjustments at different screen sizes. Grid layout is applied for the product section, and spacing and padding adjust based on the screen width (`md`, `lg`, etc.).
